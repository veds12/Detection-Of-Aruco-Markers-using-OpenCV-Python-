# Detection-Of-Aruco-Markers-using-OpenCV-Python-
This is a simple program to detect aruco markers in images as well as live videos implemented using the aruco module of OpenCV. The python documentation of the aruco module of OpenCV is a bit difficult to find and this repository contains most of the main functions required to detect aruco markers along with decent explaination. 

I was new to OpenCV when I started implementing this program and so initially spent some time familiarising myself to the basic image and video processing techniques using OpenCV. A notebook containing the codes I tested while doing this is also present in this repository

Refer to the C++ documentation of the aruco module of OpenCV if you want to further inspect the functions/objects used. A tutorial on working with aruco markers using OpenCV in C++ can be found in the link below:
https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html

Aruco markers to test the detection can be generated using the link below:

Requirements:

1.)  Python2 or above

2.)  Jupyter Notebook

3.)  OpenCV library: use 'pip install opencv-python' to install this library on linux based systems
   To use the aruco module use 'pip install opencv-contrib-python'
   You may use any other package manager such as anaconda in place of pip
